# burger

This is a burger logger app which uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, body-parser NPM packages as well as a user made ORM.

How the App Works

Allows the user to Add Burgers that they would like to eat by typing their burger choice and clicking Submit Order, which adds the burger to the Ready to Eat list.  Then the user can click the Devour button next to the burger they would like to eat, which will update the burger to the Burgers Eaten section.

The App also utilizes a JawsSQL database that is tied to Heroku.  The app has been deployed to Heroku as well and is available here: https://nameless-coast-45658.herokuapp.com/
